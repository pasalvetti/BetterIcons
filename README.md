# BetterIcons
_A UI mod for Kerbal Space Program 2_

Ever since I started playing KSP2, I've always had trouble with the part picker icons in the VAB. Especially those for fuel/engines/structures/couplers that are next to each other and look the same. I find myself clicking on each icon every time to find what I'm looking for.
This mod aims at replacing these icons with new ones that are more easily discernible and understandable.

I'm taking this opportunity to make the icons less pixelated because this style doesn't lend itself well to small images to my opinion.

## Known Issues
- Icons are no longer consistent with the Part Managers
